### Welcome to GitHub Dyncm Page.

### Dynamic Simulation 

This page contains the code snippets for few unit operations. There are many mathematical models yet to be written(or rewritten) for variety of unit operations. Currently, few mathematical models pipe, centrifugal pump, control valve, PID controller and atmospheric tank are available. 

*This project is still a work in progress and needs massive amount of work.*

Updates to the this project will be very slow and intermittent. I'm experimenting with a lot of stuff and I'm not able to devote my entire free time to this project.

Thank you for your patience and understanding and of course, following this page!
