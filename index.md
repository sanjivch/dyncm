## Welcome to GitHub Dyncm Page.

***Page under construction***

### Dynamic Simulation  

This page contains the code snippets for few unit operations. There are many mathematical models yet to be written(or rewritten) for variety of unit operations. Currently, few mathematical models such as pipe, centrifugal pump, control valve, heat exchange pipe, PID controller and atmospheric tank are available. I'm working on Flash sub-routines as well.

***This project is still a work in progress and needs massive amount of work.***

### TODO

- Pressure Flow Solver (Engine)
- Thermodynamic Solver (Engine)
- GUI for the program

Updates to the this project will be very slow and intermittent. I'm experimenting with a lot of stuff and I'm not able to devote my entire free time to this project.

Thank you for your patience and understanding and, of course, following this page!
