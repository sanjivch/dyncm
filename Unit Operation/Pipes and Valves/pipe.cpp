	//In this Equation Kâˆž is the "classic" K for a large fitting in the fully turbulent flow regime and K1 is the resistance coefficient at a Reynolds Number of 1. Note that although the K's and Re are dimensionless the fitting inside diameter (D) must be given in inches. Ref: http://www.katmarsoftware.com/articles/pipe-fitting-pressure-drop.htm
